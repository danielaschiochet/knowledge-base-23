# Bridge-Notes - Version 1

The purpose of this document is to provide short, cross-topic connectors so the chatbot can build coherent answers when a question spans multiple modules. Use with slides (PDF) and glossary (DOCX). These notes do not introduce new facts: they summarize relationships already present in the course.

# 1) CT-WIP-TH: linking factory performance (Little's Law)

· Little's Law connects Work-in-Process(WIP), Throughput (TH) and Cycle Time (CT): WIP = TH × CT (steady state).   
· Station-level decomposition: CT(i) = CTq(i) + E[Ts(i)] → total CT accumulates queueing + service over the routing.   
· The bottleneck (highest utilization u or lowest capacity) caps system TH; reducing WIP without addressing the bottleneck only shortens CT transiently.   
·Raising utilization near 1 causes nonlinear CT growth; managing WIP and variability prevents CT blow-ups at high u.   
· Use VsM timelines to connect step-level processing/waiting with end-to-end CT and inventory positions.

# 2) Variability → waiting (CTq) and utilization trade-offs

· Queueing delay depends on arrival and service variability (Ca², Cs2),utilization u,and mean service time E[Ts].   
· As u 个,CTq becomes very sensitive to variability; reducing SCV (CV²) can yield a capacity-equivalent benefit.   
·Natural processing-time variability can be lowered via task decomposition (e.g., Erlang-k phases).   
·Breakdowns/repairs inflate effective service time Te and its variability; availability a impacts E[Te] and thus u and CTq.   
·At line level, departure variability (c_d²) propagates downstream; in serial lines C a²(i)=C d²(i-1).

# 3) Choosing a modeling formalism: Flowchart vs UML vs BPMN vs IDEFO

· Flowchart: simple control-flow with standardized symbols; good for procedures with limited decisions.

· UML: multiple views - Use Case (services), Class(structure), Sequence/Statechart/Activity (behavior).   
· BPMN: process-centric with Activities, Events, Gateways; supports concurrency, pools/lanes, data objects/stores.   
· IDEFO: function-centric (ICOM: Inputs, Controls, Outputs, Mechanisms) with hierarchical decomposition.   
· Practical rule: diagram per purpose 一 requirement capture (Use Case), execution logic (BPMN/Activitv). function decomposition (IDEFO). auick procedures (Flowchart).

Glossary anchors: Flowchart, UML (overview), BPMN (overview), BPMN core elements, Pools & Lanes, IDEFO (overview)

# 4) From Operative Structure to VSM: BOM → operations/resources → lead time

·Product tree/BOM defines components; precedence yields the graph of operations and feasible working seauences.   
· The OP-Resource matrix and resource graph allocate operations to workstations and schedules (Gantt).   
· In VSM, each step becomes a Process box with data (C/T,setup, uptime, VA,scrap); inventories and timelines expose waitina vs processina.   
· Lead time emerges from aggregating process and waiting times across the flow; inventory icons mark WiP and safetv stocks.   
· Use this bridge to translate structural views (BOM/graphs) into flow views (VSM) consistent with CT/WIP/TH metrirs

# 5) Multi-product and re-entrant flows: routing and mixtures at stations

· Re-entrant flows revisit the same workstation; from the station perspective this is equivalent to multiple ‘product tvpes'.   
·At a station,service time is a mixture over products weighted by their arrival shares → use composite mean/SCV.   
· Workload and utilization per station: WL k =∑ iλ i.k E[Tsli.k)l. u k = WL k / c k.   
·Network-level routing matrices (per product) combine into composite routing for shared aueues without brioritv.   
· Per-product mean time in factorv aggregates CTa(k)+E[Tsli.k)l along the visited stations.

# 6) Batch models: transport, setup reduction, k-at-once service

·Transport batching reduces arrival rate by k and changes inter-arrival SCV; batch forming adds (k-1)/2 · E[Td] on average.

· At receiving stations, CTq per item can match single-item flow with same u and individual SCVs.   
· Intra-batch processing adds (k-1)/2 · E[Ts] per item when processed sequentially.   
·Setup-before-batch:amortize setups R over k items (E[R]/k) but batch added formation/processing delays.   
·Batch service (k-at-once) couples batch inter-arrival/service variability with utilization u(B); choose k via CT trade-off.

# 7) Information systems & Industry 4.O: data to decisions on the shop floor

· ERP integrates cross-functional data; MES provides real-time execution (dispatching, tracking, status) from PLC/SCADA sources.   
· PLM governs product data across lifecycle; horizontal/vertical integration enable end-to-end data flow.   
· loT/lloT and cloud platforms collect/serve data for monitoring,analytics and optimization (e.g., WIP/CT dashboards).   
· Predictive maintenance and condition monitoring reduce effective service time variability (fewer breakdowns → lower CTq).   
· Cyber-security is a prerequisite as connectivity expands the attack surface.

# 8) Analytical models vs Discrete-Event Simulation (DES): when to use which

·Analytical'factory models'decompose lines/stations and are fast for sensitivity and design rules (u, CT, TH, WIP).   
· DES represents events (arivals, starts/ends, breakdowns) and states (queues, machines, operators) enabling what-if scenarios with complex logic and variability.   
· Verification vs Validation: build the model right vs build the right model; remove initial transient before steady-state statistics.   
· Use DES to validate scheduling rules,batching, re-entrant flows, resource sharing; use analytics for quick back-of-the-envelope checks and parameter sweeps.   
· Triangulate: DES results should be consistent with Litle's Law and queueing approximations at comparable u and variability.

# 9) Heterogeneous Servers

When modeling a single workstation with heterogeneous servers (where $\mu_{fast} \neq \mu_{slow}$), the following rules must be strictly followed to ensure the accuracy of the Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC).

1. State Space Definition (Micro-States): To avoid the error of "over-aggregation," do not use a simple integer $n$ (total jobs) as the state. Instead, use micro-states that explicitly identify which specific machines are occupied.

0: The system is empty.
  $1f$: One job is being processed by the fast machine.
  $1s$: One job is being processed by the slow machine.$2fs$: Two jobs in service (one on fast, one on slow).
  $2ss$: Two jobs in service (both on slow machines), with the fast machine idle.
  $3$: All three machines are occupied.
  $n > 3$: All machines are occupied, plus $n-3$ jobs waiting in the queue.

2. Routing Logic & Reachability: The modeling must reflect the "Fastest-Free" assignment policy while accounting for service-driven transitions.
   Fastest-Free Rule: If the system is in state $0$ and a job arrives, it must be assigned to the fast machine ($0 \to 1f$).
   Service Transitions: States like $1s$ and $2ss$ are often unreachable via arrival arcs but must be included because they are reachable via service     completions.

   Example: From state $2fs$, if the fast machine finishes first, the system moves to $1s$ ($2fs \xrightarrow{\mu_f} 1s$).
   Example: From state $3$, if the fast machine finishes, the system moves to $2ss$ ($3 \xrightarrow{\mu_f} 2ss$).

3.KPI Calculations (Performance Metrics): Performance metrics must be calculated by weighting the steady-state probabilities ($\pi_x$) of the specific micro-states.
  Work-In-Process (WIP)The total WIP is the weighted sum of the number of jobs $n(x)$ in each micro-state $x$:
  
  $$WIP = \sum_{x \in S} n(x) \cdot \pi_x$$
  
  Throughput (TH)For systems with a finite capacity $K$, the throughput must account for the blocking probability at the maximum state:
  
  $$TH = \lambda \cdot (1 - \pi_K)$$
  
  Cycle Time (CT)Calculated using Little’s Law:
  
  $$CT = \frac{WIP}{TH}$$
