## Usage note for chatbot

When a user query involves:
- **Variability, queues, utilization** → files 03, 04, 05
- **Multiple products or routings** → file 06
- **Batching** → file 07
- **Process representation** → file 01
- **Digital manufacturing / Industry 4.0 / Group Technology** → file 09

This mapping should be used as the primary routing logic for retrieval‑augmented generation.
